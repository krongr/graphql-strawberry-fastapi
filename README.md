# GraphQL API with FastAPI, Strawberry, and MongoDB
## Introduction
This repository serves as a testament to my journey diving into GraphQL, enriched later with the addition of MongoDB. Initially embarked upon as a learning venture, the project matured significantly with rigorous practice, and now also stands as a robust template for anyone looking to build similar projects. A testament to the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach, every layer of this project has been meticulously crafted with the highest standards in mind.

## Highlights:
- **Journey From Bottom-Up to Top-Down:** The project initially started with a straightforward build process. With evolving knowledge, it transitioned to a top-bottom approach empowered by TDD.

- **Beyond Just a Learning Project:** With comprehensive test coverage and adherence to best practices, it's not just a learning repository but also a potential foundation for similar projects.

- **CRUD Evolution:** The 'read' functionality stands robust and complete. Further CRUD operations will be implemented systematically, ensuring each vertical is perfect before moving to the next.

- **Refined Version Control:** My approach to version control and commit messaging has matured significantly. From a certain stage, it genuinely represents a guide to the project's progression and encapsulates the learning journey.

- **Optimized Data Fetching:** Leveraging the capabilities of GraphQL, this project introduces a deliberate fetch control system based on the client's gql query. It ensures that only the necessary data is retrieved, showcasing an efficient and thoughtful integration of GraphQL.

- **Self-Referencing with Recursion Control:** Successfully implemented a self-referencing GraphQL type, with a recursion control mechanism. This was among the most challenging design facets, and its accomplishment stands as a significant milestone.

- **On the Horizon:** Future enhancements encompass in-memory caching for optimized data retrieval, pagination for voluminous requests like "get all", richer documentation, heightened error management and dockerization to streamline deployment processes.

## Setup and Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- pip
- MongoDB

## Concluding Thoughts
While the project has seen considerable growth, integrating best practices and transitioning from SQLite to MongoDB, its primary intent remains educational. It's an exemplary resource for those exploring GraphQL and can also be adopted as a foundational framework for building new APIs. Always ensure you adapt and rigorously test before considering it for any production use.
