# FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL API Application
## Introduction
This repository showcases a GraphQL API application that stands as a testament to my evolving journey with GraphQL. Meticulously crafted with FastAPI, Strawberry, and the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern, this project integrates MongoDB, replacing the initial SQLite database. It's both a showcase of capabilities and a high-quality template for similar projects.

## Project Overview
Dive into a world of characters, their unique powers, and adversaries with this application. As my understanding of GraphQL deepened, this project transformed to reflect the potential of GraphQL when combined with FastAPI, Strawberry, and MongoDB.

The initial SQLite database has been replaced by MongoDB, empowered by the ODM mongoengine for queries. To kickstart your experience, a prefill script and accompanying JSON data files are provided, ensuring a smooth beginning.

### Key Highlights:
- Comprehensive documentation from method to module level.
- Robust error handling bolstered by a dedicated logger module with file handlers.
- Adherence to the DAO pattern for data access.

### Upcoming Enhancements:
- Implementation of recursion depth control to guard against stack overflows.
- Introduction of unit and integration tests.
- Dockerization for seamless deployment and scaling.

## Prerequisites
Before diving in, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- MongoDB

## Note
While this project has matured considerably with enhanced error handling, refined documentation, and a shift from SQLite to MongoDB, it's intended primarily as a qualitative template and a reference showcase. As always, adapt and test thoroughly before considering any production use.
