# FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL API Application
This repository contains a GraphQL API application I developed as part of my journey in mastering GraphQL. Built with FastAPI, Strawberry, and the Repository pattern, it comes equipped with a pre-loaded SQLite database, allowing immediate interaction and exploration.

## Project Overview
While I delved into the depths of GraphQL, I crafted this application, which became a testament to the potential of GraphQL combined with technologies like FastAPI and Strawberry. The focus lies in CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations, letting users delve into the world of characters, their unique powers, and their adversaries.

The application's SQLite database is pre-populated, eliminating the need for initial setup or data input, providing a seamless start.

A heads-up: I concentrated on getting the functionalities right and showcasing GraphQL capabilities, so error handling remains minimal. While the project serves as a rich demonstration of GraphQL and its interplay with FastAPI and Strawberry, it's best suited as a template or a point of reference rather than for production use.
