# FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL API Application
This repository hosts a learning-oriented GraphQL API application, devised using FastAPI, Strawberry, and the Repository pattern. Additionally, it includes a pre-populated SQLite database file, enabling immediate use of the application.

## Project Overview
This initiative primarily serves as an educational platform for understanding and implementing GraphQL, using technologies like FastAPI, Strawberry, and the Repository pattern. The project does not cover all potential use cases, with the main focus on effectively executing CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations for characters, their powers, and enemies.

The application comes pre-packaged with a pre-filled SQLite database file, enabling users to immediately use and interact with the application, without the need for additional setup or data entry.

Please note that error handling has been kept to a minimal level. The primary objective of this project is to showcase the basic functionalities of a GraphQL API and the effective use of FastAPI and Strawberry. While it can be used as a practical learning tool or a template for similar applications, it may not be entirely suited for full production use.
